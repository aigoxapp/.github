Building practical AI Agents that do real work—securely, reliably, and at scale.
Welcome to aigoxapp’s GitHub home. We’re building an automation platform powered by AI Agents—specialized, goal-driven assistants that coordinate tasks, talk to tools and APIs, and deliver dependable results for everyday productivity and operations.

# ✨ What we’re building
	•	Agent Core – a lightweight runtime for planning, tool-use, memory, and safe execution
	•	Multi-Agent Orchestrator – assign roles (Planner, Researcher, Operator), route tasks, and synchronize outcomes
	•	Integration Hub – connectors for calendars, email, docs, chats, CRMs, and internal APIs
	•	Observability & Guardrails – structured logs, reproducible runs, permissions, and compliance-ready controls
	•	Templates – ready-to-use agents (Inbox Triage, Meeting Concierge, Research Scout, Ops Automator)

Our north star: Agents that are useful on day one, and trustworthy for the long run.

# 🧩 Why AI Agents (now)?
	•	Tool-use is finally dependable enough for real workflows
	•	LLM reasoning is great—paired with deterministic adapters and human-in-the-loop where it matters
	•	Organizations want automation without giving up privacy, auditability, or control

# 📦 Repos (rolling out)
	•	agent-core – core runtime & agent abstraction (public soon)
	•	agent-recipes – production-ready templates & blueprints
	•	integrations – connectors (Google, Microsoft 365, Slack, Notion, HubSpot, custom REST)
	•	orchestrator – multi-agent routing, scheduling, and state
	•	playground – UI to design, test, and observe agents

# 🚀 Quick start (preview)

## 1) Install (placeholder package while we publish)
pip install aigoxapp-agents  # or: npm i @aigoxapp/agents

## 2) Create your first agent
aigox init my-agent

## 3) Run locally with a test tool
aigox run --tool calendar.list --goal "Plan a 30-min sync this week"

Packages will be published under aigoxapp on PyPI and npm. Until then, this is a preview of developer ergonomics we aim for.

# 🔐 Security & Privacy
	•	Least-privilege tokens and scoped tool permissions
	•	Encrypted secrets & environment isolation
	•	Human oversight options for sensitive actions (approve/deny)
	•	Reproducible run logs for audits

Security issues? Please email security@aigoxapp.com.

# 🗺️ Roadmap (high level)
	•	v0.1 – Agent Core alpha, local runners, OpenAI/Anthropic providers
	•	v0.2 – Orchestrator beta, basic UI, first 10 integrations
	•	v0.3 – Guardrails/Policies, memory stores, enterprise auth
	•	v1.0 – Stable SDKs, hosted & self-hosted options, production SLAs

Track progress in our public Projects board (coming soon).
